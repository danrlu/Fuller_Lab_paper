Contains genes in each group, and the associated CAGE clusters. CAGE clusters were first called in bam-/- sample, and in 72hrPHS sample separately, but for counting reads, they needed to be merged into 1 set of consensus clusters (see folder 1.sequencing data processing). So each gene is associated with CAGE clusters in bam-/- or 72hrPHS and also with consensus clusters.
