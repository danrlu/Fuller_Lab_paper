clusterTSS_bam.txt is CAGE clusters built with bam-/- sample (merging replicates). In which q_0.1 and q_0.9 are RETI 5' and 3' edges (note q_0.1 corresponds to RETI 5' on + strand, and RETI 3' on - strand).

clusterTSS_HS72.txt is CAGE clusters built with 72hrPHS sample.

consensusCluster.txt was built by merging the clusters in bam-/- and in 72hrPHS samples, and used for counting and comparing reads across samples. See 1.sequencing_data_processing/CAGE for details. 

The *ensembl.bed versions are converted to .bed and using Ensembl chromosome convention.
