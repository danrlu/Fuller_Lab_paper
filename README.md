# Scripts for the paper from D. Lu, H. Sin, C. Lu and M. T. Fuller.

**1.sequencing_data_processing** includes scripts that process raw sequencing data (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CAGE) to (a) files for viewing in genomic browser (b) read counts (normalized and differential expression) to downstream analysis

**2.data_integrative_analysis** includes scripts that integrates all available data to define gene groups. 

**3.sequencing_data_heatmap** includes scripts that takes processed sequencing data in 1.a and gene groups from 2. to plot genomic heatmaps with deepTools

**4.motif_analysis** includes scripts for MEME suites

**5.motifs_plots** includes scripts for seqPattern plots
